/*Description of Coin Change Problem with Examples

Description: Given a value N, if we want to make change for an amount of money N, 
and we have infinite supply of each of S = { S1, S2, .. , Sm} valued coins, 
how many ways can we make the change? The order of coins doesnâ€™t matter.

Example:
N = 4 & S = {1,2,3}, there are four solutions: {1,1,1,1},{1,1,2},{2,2},{1,3}. 
So output should be 4. 
N = 10 and S = {2, 5, 3, 6}, there are five solutions: 
{2,2,2,2,2}, {2,2,3,3}, {2,2,6}, {2,3,5} and {5,5}. So the output should be 5. */
